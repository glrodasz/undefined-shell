# Welcome to the English Version

This is a sample English post to demonstrate how the internationalization system works. 

## Features

- Clean URLs without locale prefix for English content
- Separate content collections for each language
- Locale-aware layouts and components

## Getting Started

This post demonstrates that the i18n system is working correctly!
